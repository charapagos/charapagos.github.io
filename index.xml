      <guid>https://charapagos.github.io/charm-of-characters-to-empower-messages/</guid>
      <description>Cinematic Communication expects characters for example ones in animation works to give more power to sentences and messages making the best use of their features including their appearance and personality.
You can tell more effectively about what you want to say to your partner only because of adding the feature of a specific character on sentences or messages in some cases.
If you wish to prompt a smile from your communication partner, there are more possibilities to do so through selecting a popper character appeared in a comedy work and sending encouraging words with it than only sentences or messages.</description>

      <description>Cinematic Communication holds up three aims.
1. Cinematic Communication will propose a more positive, heartfelt and lively communication style. These days we can see remarkable progress in both the hardware and software of mobile devices. The performance has almost achieved the same level of personal computer.
You cannot make use of the technical progress fully as long as you consume it only by downloading and watching video data or sending and receiving short messages.</description>

      <description>For example, it is common that characters in animation works have features of not only their appearance but also personality as its name suggests. Users tend to have an emotional attachment to them because of these kinds of features.
Then because of their emotional attachment to the characters, we can say that they also tend to love the works themselves. If they do not feel sympathy towards any characters in the works, there is almost no way for them to evaluate the works highly.</description>

      <description>Only moving characters is not the purpose of Cinematic Communication.
The purpose is to let users enjoy a new type of communication through the expression or action of characters.
However, most of them have few experiences to create characters by themselves and invent how to make them express or act.
Then that is where professional creators come in.
Whether characters are given expression, life through being acted and value as animation or not will depend on creators’ skill.</description>

      <description>Cinematic Communication is quite compatible with 3D animation characters. Of course you can also sufficiently enjoy with 2D ones. However, 3D ones are expected to extend the possibility of Cinematic Communication furthermore.
As compared with 2D characters originated in traditional animation, 3D ones are created by modeling the whole part of them from the beginning. After that it is easier to make them express and act as their feature. Cinematic Communication can follow the feature directly.</description>

      <description>These days under the name of ecosystems many online services tend to enclose their users providing additional services including game, music or publication that are different from initial ones such as SNS or short message.
We can say that this is a necessary method to make a profit from other services because most of their initial ones are provided by free. However, it is also truth that this kind of enclosing often becomes inconvenient for their users because it makes them difficult to communicate with others who use different ecosystems or keeps recommending unnecessary services.</description>

To be more precise, it has a function to combine emotional words or phrases in sentences that users wrote with characters’ expression or action data.
Combination between emotional words and characters’ expression or action data is up to users and everybody can do it easily.
Once they write sentences normally, Emotional Engine will automatically find emotional words in them and select appropriate characters’ expression or action data along with that.</description>

      <description>Before starting Cinematic Communication, online storage is necessary to save and manage character data and exchanged messages.
By means of using online storage, you can enjoy Cinematic Communication anytime, anywhere and from any devices.
Not only users but also distributors do not need to set up their own server and provide their own online storage service.
Cinematic Communication itself does not provide its own online storage service too. Users and distributors by themselves need to pick up service that they usually use or other one that they can trust.</description>

      <title>Multiply Filtering System</title>

      <guid>https://charapagos.github.io/multiply-filtering-system/</guid>
      <description>Multiply Filtering System is built in Emotional Engine as its main function. The system is composed of multiple filters and they are put on top of each other. Grid shaped areas are set in each filter.
Expression or action data for a character is located on each grid shaped area in a filter one by one. It is called a character filter.
Words or phrases that show emotion or action are also located on each grid shaped area in other filter.</description>

      <guid>https://charapagos.github.io/combination-of-filters/</guid>
      <description>As its name suggests, Multiply Filtering System can combine many filters together.
The basic scheme is to make data recorded on a first filter have priority over other data on lower filters.
On the other hand, if there are no relevant words or phrases in data recorded on the first filter, then the system will try to find relevance in data recorded on the second, third or lower filters in turn.</description>

      <title>Types of data to be registered on filters</title>

      <guid>https://charapagos.github.io/types-of-data-to-be-registered-on-filters/</guid>
      <description>Two types of data, character data and words or phrases related to expression data are basic to be registered on filters. However, you can register a variety of data without them.
For example, after you register temperature data from minus 20C until 50C in advance, you can combine a phrase that suggests more than 25C in a message with character data that express sweating. On the contrary when a phrase that suggests less than 10C is used, character data that express freezing can be combined with the phrase.</description>

      <description>Everybody can easily distribute a variety of expression and action data for characters to enjoy Cinematic Communication.
Basically distribution from an online store for business or distribution by an individual creator without charge uses a same scheme.
It is only putting data to distribute in a download site that you usually use.
Please pay attention to a file name of each data at that time.
For example, please name &amp;ldquo;pleasure&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; on data expressing smile.</description>

Heartfelt and lively communication with only reliable partners matches with the features of Cinematic Communication and it sounds logical for most of them.</description>

What the creators mean here includes not only professionals who are working in media and content industries but also persons who can exercise their creativity that is expected in any types of workplaces.
What the users mean here includes not only the audience of movie but also persons who can definitely assess the social, economical and cultural value of creative activities and the results.</description>

      <description>The most effective way to admit the value of creativeness is to experience creative activities.
A part of profits that Cinematic Communication can yield will be used to provide children educational opportunities to increase their creativeness.
It means that users can directly contribute to the educational opportunities for fostering children’s creativeness.
On the other words, they can invest in the future of creative activities.
The reason why Cinematic Communication was developed is to provide these kinds of educational opportunities in the background.</description>
