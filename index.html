                    Cinematic Communication expects characters for example ones in animation works to give more power to sentences and messages making the best use of their features including their appearance and personality.
You can tell more effectively about what you want to say to your partner only because of adding the feature of a specific character on sentences or messages in some cases.
If you wish to prompt a smile from your communication partner, there are more possibilities to do so through selecting a popper character appeared in a comedy work and sending encouraging words with it than only sentences or messages.

                    Cinematic Communication holds up three aims.
1. Cinematic Communication will propose a more positive, heartfelt and lively communication style. These days we can see remarkable progress in both the hardware and software of mobile devices. The performance has almost achieved the same level of personal computer.
You cannot make use of the technical progress fully as long as you consume it only by downloading and watching video data or sending and receiving short messages.

                    For example, it is common that characters in animation works have features of not only their appearance but also personality as its name suggests. Users tend to have an emotional attachment to them because of these kinds of features.
Then because of their emotional attachment to the characters, we can say that they also tend to love the works themselves. If they do not feel sympathy towards any characters in the works, there is almost no way for them to evaluate the works highly.

                    Only moving characters is not the purpose of Cinematic Communication.
The purpose is to let users enjoy a new type of communication through the expression or action of characters.
However, most of them have few experiences to create characters by themselves and invent how to make them express or act.
Then that is where professional creators come in.
Whether characters are given expression, life through being acted and value as animation or not will depend on creatorsâ€™ skill.

                    Cinematic Communication is quite compatible with 3D animation characters. Of course you can also sufficiently enjoy with 2D ones. However, 3D ones are expected to extend the possibility of Cinematic Communication furthermore.
As compared with 2D characters originated in traditional animation, 3D ones are created by modeling the whole part of them from the beginning. After that it is easier to make them express and act as their feature. Cinematic Communication can follow the feature directly.

                    Most of the technologies that support Cinematic Communication are prevailed worldwide and everybody is using them in their everyday online life.
For example, they are a URL and web browser.
Everybody can easily try Cinematic Communication only putting a URL automatically generated by Emotional Engine embedded in charapagos on mails, SNS, short messages, Weblog and so on.

                    These days under the name of ecosystems many online services tend to enclose their users providing additional services including game, music or publication that are different from initial ones such as SNS or short message.
We can say that this is a necessary method to make a profit from other services because most of their initial ones are provided by free. However, it is also truth that this kind of enclosing often becomes inconvenient for their users because it makes them difficult to communicate with others who use different ecosystems or keeps recommending unnecessary services.
