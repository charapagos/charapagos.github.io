<p>Cinematic Communication has a network structure that makes the best use of advantages of cloud computing and P to P technologies.</p>

<p>The scheme doses not work to centralize in one place.  It is composed of the most common Internet technologies in the world.  They are a URL and web browser.</p>

<p>It means that technically you can enjoy Cinematic Communication on any existing online services such as Weblog or SNS.</p>

<p>Each user, creator and distributor can join in Cinematic Communication with a minimum cost.</p>

<p>Every operation related to Cinematic Communication will be conducted on hardware such as personal computers or mobile devices that users own.  It means that creators and distributors do not need to set up a special server for the purpose.</p>

<p>Using online storage and P to P technologies, users can enjoy Cinematic Communication anytime and anyplace as long as they have an Internet connection.</p>

<p>Even for creators and distributors they can use online storage to distribute character data instead of setting up their own download server.  In that case, they can distribute character data with a minimum cost.  Of course they can also set up their own commercial download server.</p>

<p>In either case of using online service or setting their own download server, they do not need to save and manage character data that users have already downloaded and owned and message data that is exchanged among them.  They can completely place a burden on online storage and P to P technologies.</p>

<p>The network structure for each player is as follows.</p>

<h3 id="users">Users</h3>

<p>They need to have a personal computer or mobile device in which Emotional Engine and the latest version of a web browser are installed and online storage.</p>

<p>A web browser is used as a body to install Emotional Engine and enjoy Cinematic Communication.</p>

<p>Online storage is used to save character data and messages.</p>

<p>All processes of converting messages that users write into Cinematic Communication will be done on usersâ€™ personal computers or mobile devices.</p>

<p>Users do not need to set up a special server to convert messages or enjoy Cinematic Communication.</p>

<p>Every character data and message data will be basically saved and managed in online storage.</p>

<h3 id="creators">Creators</h3>

<p>Creators can use any kinds of software to make characters as long as they are familiar with them.</p>

<p>Emotional Engine does not have a function to make characters.</p>

<p>Regarding the file name of character data, creators need to put an appropriate name on each data according to its expression or action.</p>

<p>They need to have a personal computer or mobile device in which Emotional Engine and the latest version of a web browser are installed and online storage to check actions of characters that they made.</p>

<p>Regarding distribution of characters, you can refer to an item related to distributors.</p>

<h3 id="distributors">Distributors</h3>

<p>Distributors need to set up a download site and server to distribute character data by themselves.</p>

<p>They can use existing free online storage service for small business.</p>

<p>We recommend that they will broaden Internet bandwidths for their download site along with the number of downloading by users.</p>

<p>If they wish to distribute character data for business, they need to set up an online settlement system by themselves.</p>

<p>On the other hands, they do not need to set up a special server for users to convert message data and play back Cinematic Communication.  They can just dedicate themselves to distributing character data.</p>
