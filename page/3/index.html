                    By means of Trust Alliance scheme, as long as users keep exchanging a public key that is necessary to encrypt a set of data for Cinematic Communication including character data with only partners that they can trust, they can also technically respect the right of character data that creators made.
Heartfelt and lively communication with only reliable partners matches with the features of Cinematic Communication and it sounds logical for most of them.

                    Cinematic Communication will promote cooperation between creators and users and create more attractive characters and their expression.
While the ability of computer is rapidly increasing, on the contrary the price is drastically going down year by year, a hurdle to try a variety of expressive activities is lowered. While respecting cultural diversity is held up as a primary condition in order to develop the world community, it serves as the driving force to create new contents.

                    Cinematic Communication can shorten the distance between creators and users.
Through Cinematic Communication, users can feel more familiar with an excellent ability to express that professional creators possess.
For users, Cinematic Communication can provide them more opportunities to enjoy works made by creators.
For creators, shortening the distance with users through Cinematic Communication will be important more than before.
An animation industry has already reached the level to produce high quality works more or less than live action films through advanced division of labor system.

                    For example, behind the US gigantic media and content market we can see a number of creators who produce enough works to match the size of the market and a huge number of users who are keen audiences to sustain the market.
Most of Americans are given a chance to create an audiovisual work as a creator in public educational activities and the experience leads to foster their eyes to evaluate the value of creative activities and works as the result.

                    The most effective way to admit the value of creativeness is to experience creative activities.
A part of profits that Cinematic Communication can yield will be used to provide children educational opportunities to increase their creativeness.
It means that users can directly contribute to the educational opportunities for fostering children’s creativeness.
On the other words, they can invest in the future of creative activities.
The reason why Cinematic Communication was developed is to provide these kinds of educational opportunities in the background.

                    We as developers for Cinematic Communication have a history to keep supporting carrier educational activities that aim to foster the next generation of creators and users cooperating with Japanese major animation studios for more than 10 years.
Every year around 60 to 100 sixth graders in an elementary school joined these educational activities and produced original short animation films at a group unit following professional animation production procedure.
The report for FY 2015 carrier educational activities with academic analysis is uploaded on the following URL.

                    Some of animation works produced by elementary school students under carrier educational activities that we as developers for Cinematic Communication keep supporting have been sent to Independent Animation Festival sponsored by Mitaka city government and nearby major animation studios for 10 years.
